* Example

Start by calling =(org-ls-load-file (buffer-file-name))= to load this file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-ls-load-file (buffer-file-name))
#+end_src

The following codeblock will be loaded into org-ls:

#+name: open-url
#+begin_src sh :var url="http://google.com/"
  google-chrome-stable $url
#+end_src

You can now invoke it with either =(org-ls-do "open-url" :url "http://bing.com")=
or through the evaluated helper via =(open-url "http://bing.com")=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun open-url (url)
    (org-ls-do "open-url" :url url))
#+end_src

Finally, since the =open-url= is in this file, you could also call it directly
via =(org-ls-call "open-url" :url "http://bing.com")=
